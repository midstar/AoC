# Advent of Code - solutions

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

This repo contains some tools that might be of interest for other AoC puzzle
solvers. 

[tools/fetch_input.js](tools/fetch_input.js) is a script that can fetch the
input for each puzzle and also the answer for each puzzle (if you have solved them).

[tools/runner.py](tools/runner.py) is a script that can execute one or multiple
puzzles. It measures that execution time and is also able to check if the answer
was correct or not.
